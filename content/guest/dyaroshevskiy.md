Denis is a semi-active member of the C++ community. He is mostly interested in algorithms and has done a few things in that area such as: research and implementation of Chromium's flat_set, a couple of tiny contributions to libc++ algorithm library, a few algorithm related talks and one sole paper to the C++ standard that didn't get consensus. For the last couple of years in his free time Denis is implementing STL algorithms portably using SIMD.
