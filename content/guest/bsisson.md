Billy is the Director of Motion Planning at Exyn, with prior experience at United Technologies (now Raytheon technologies).  He studied Computer Science and Systems in undergrad at Rensselaer Polytechnic, with focus on robotics, controls, and electrical engineering.  He's been programming professionally using C++ for 12 years.
At Exyn, Billy focuses on the autonomy of the robot- how does the robot build a searchable map of the environment? How does the robot efficiently generate safe paths from A to B? How does the robot explore the environment in a way that maximizes information gain?
