Piotr started working as a C++ dev in 2005, working on a System Verilog compiler. Since 2010 he's been working for Future Processing in Poland. He's worked on many commercial projects since then, not always as a C++ developer. Piotr had a minor detour as a Fullstack .NET web developer (did not like it).
Piotr was an organizers of a 24 hour competitive programming marathon: Deadline24, which was last held in 2018.
His main interest as a C++ developer was always compilers and parsers, which eventually lead to the creation of ctpg.
