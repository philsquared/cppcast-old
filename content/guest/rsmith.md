Richard is a professional C++ language lawyer at Google and one of the three leads of the Carbon language project. He has worked in great depth on the C++ core language, has authored over a hundred C++ committee papers, and was the editor for the C++17 and C++20 standards. Until recently, he was the lead developer of the Clang compiler. When not working on the guts of programming languages, he likes to play pool, and to annoy his cats by playing the piano.
