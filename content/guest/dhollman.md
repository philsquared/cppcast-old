Dr. Daisy S. Hollman has been involved in the C++ standards committee since 2016, where she has made contributions to a wide range of library and language features, including proposals related to executors, atomics, generic programming, futures, and multidimensional arrays. Since receiving her Ph.D. in Quantum Chemistry in 2013, her research has focused primarily on parallel and concurrent programming models, though a broader focus on general accessibility of complex abstractions has become her focus in more recent years. She currently works on C++ language and library design at Google, where she continues to focus on providing broad accessibility of programming models and library interfaces, with a particular focus on design for diversity and inclusivity.
