Hartmut is a faculty member at the CS and EE departments at Louisiana State University (LSU) and a senior research scientist at LSU's Center for Computation and Technology (CCT). He is probably best known through his involvement in open source software projects, such as being the author of several C++ libraries he has contributed to Boost, which are in use by thousands of developers worldwide. His current research is focused on leading the STE||AR group at CCT working on the practical design and implementation of future execution models and programming methods. These things are tried out and tested using the HPX – A C++ Standard library for Concurrency and Parallelism. Hartmut’s goal is to enable the creation of a new generation of scientific applications in powerful, though complex environments, such as high performance and distributed computing, spatial information systems, and compiler technologies.
