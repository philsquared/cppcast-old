Nina attended a UK meeting 10 years ago as an observer. 
She was curious to see how the committee works. 
On the third day she sat in with Core and they were kind enough to let her sprinkle a few commas in the wording at hand, and from that moment on, she was hooked.
These days she is the committee secretary and one of the directors of the C++ Foundation.
Throughout her career she has worked for Siemens, Motorola, Datasift, and Symantec on everything from parts of the UMTS network to cloud based antivirus products.
She is currently working on allocator friendly library types.
