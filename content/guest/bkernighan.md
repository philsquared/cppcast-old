Brian Kernighan received his PhD from Princeton in 1969, and was in the Computing Science Research center at Bell Labs until 2000.  He is now a professor in the Computer Science Department at Princeton, where he writes short programs and longer books.  The latter are better than the former, and certainly need less  maintenance.
