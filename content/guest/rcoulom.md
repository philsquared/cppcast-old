Remi was born in 1974 and started to code in 1983, he wrote his first C++ code around 1992 with Borland Turbo C++, and it has been his main programming language since then. Remi completed his PhD in cognitive science in 2002 with a research topic of reinforcement learning with artificial neural networks. He invented MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search), and applied it to the game of Go, with his Go program winning many international computer Go tournaments. In 2010 Remi was contacted by Unbalance Corporation, a Japanese publisher, who offered to buy a licence of his code. In 2014, Remi quit the University of Lille to create his own company, Kayufu, and work full time on developing game AI software.
