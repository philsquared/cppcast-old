David is an Australian developer. Originally from the island of Tasmania, where in true Aussie style his family had a small sheep farm, today he lives in far northern Europe in Estonia. He began programming with a BBC microcomputer, and was hired for his first programming job, using C++, without ever having used it. In the week before starting work he borrowed a copy of Stroustrup from a friend of a friend and read it cover to cover. David has a strong interest in user experience, and improving what it's like to use software and programming languages. He joined Embarcadero as the C++ Product Manager in 2016, and today works as the product manager for both C++Builder and Whole Tomato's Visual Assist.
