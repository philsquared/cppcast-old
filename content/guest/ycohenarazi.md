Kobi is a Principal Software Engineer in Qualcomm San Diego where he works on the next generation of 5G Cellular and Radio Access Networks. In the past he also worked on Machine Learning, Automotive, WiFi and 4G domains.
Kobi is a father of 3 kids where the oldest one is a sophomore in CS that is still not fully committed to learning C++.
Kobi is currently working with Dorothy Kirk on an upcoming new C++ Object Oriented book and helping Dorothy to modernize C++ code.
He has been running the San Diego C++ Meetup for the past 3 years where he presents various topics that hopefully help others to write better C++ code.
In his “spare” time Kobi likes riding his Road and Mountain bicycles as well as Swimming (not at the same time of course).
He usually listens to cppcast and other podcasts while walking his dog - Julia.
