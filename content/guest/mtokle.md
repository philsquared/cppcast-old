Marit Tokle and Christian Resell join Rob and Jason. They first talk about a Y2K like bug that unexpectedly hit us in the new year. Then they talk about binary exploits, why they're still relevant, and a particular binary exploit that Marit and Christian demonstrated during their recent talk at NDC Techtown. They also talk about 'Capture The Flag' security competitions.
