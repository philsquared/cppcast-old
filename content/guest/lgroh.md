Linus started his programming journey in 2012 fiddling around with languages like Python and JavaScript, eventually combining them in his work as a full stack web developer. Later he decided to learn C++ and dive into operating system development by contributing to the SerenityOS project, where he is now a maintainer and active member of the community. You'll mostly find him working on the system's own JavaScript engine, LibJS.
