Rob Irving is a Software Engineer with [Sierra Nevada Corporation](https://www.sncorp.com/) in Holly Springs, NC. He started the CppCast podcast in February 2015, frustrated by the lack of podcast content for C++ development.

A believer in continuous education, he loves learning about new technologies, often through podcasts!
