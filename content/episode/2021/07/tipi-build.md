Description = "Rob and Jason are joined by Damien Buhl and Yannic Staudt from tipi.build. They first talk about a new text encoding library and whether const should be the default for variables. Then they talk about tipi.build, the Compiler-as-a-Service that understands C++ code and can build it without scripts."
