Description = "Mike Daum joins Phil and Timur. After some community news, including the state of modules support in CMake and a new compile-time parsing library inspired by Rust's macros, we talk to Mike about CppNorth - what it is, how it got started and what makes it different - then about company cultures, a new language from Epic, and the importance of catering to 'Dark Matter Developers'."
