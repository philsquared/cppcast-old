Description = "Mark Hoemmen joins Rob and Jason. They first talk about an debugging improvements in VS Code and C++20/23 features going into MSVC. Then they talk to Mark Hoemmen about his past work on linear algebra libraries Tpetra and Kokkos, and current efforts to get linear algebra into the standard."
