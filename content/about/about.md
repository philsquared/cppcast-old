## CppCast
From 2015 to 2022 CppCast had (almost) weekly conversations with C++ conference speakers, library authors, writers, ISO committee members and more!

In May 2022 on the 349th episode Rob and Jason announced the podcast would be going on an 'indefinite hiatus' after 7 years of regular episodes.

In December 2022, Rob and Jason returned for a 350th episode, where they handed over to Phil Nash and Timur Doumler, who became the new hosts of the show.
