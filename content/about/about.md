## CppCast
From 2015 to 2022 CppCast had (almost) weekly conversations with C++ conference speakers, library authors, writers, ISO committee members and more!

In May 2022 on the 349th episode Rob and Jason announced the podcast would be going on an 'indefinite hiatus' after 7 years of regular episodes.

Rob and Jason can be reached on twitter at [@robwirving](https://twitter.com/robwirving) and [@lefticus](https://twitter.com/lefticus).
